# Pelican Collection Website

A personal website for cataloguing my **Pelican Books** collection, built with **Python** and **Flask**.  
This project is designed to be:
- Visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Modular and easily extended with new features over time.
- A public example of my development skills for job applications.
- A transparent record of how I use **ChatGPT** to assist in software development.
